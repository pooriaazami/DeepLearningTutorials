Although Pytorch --another deep learning library-- is getting more and more popular, TensorFlow is still one the best choices.\n",

It is a high-level framework which uses TensorFlow behind the scenes to generate deep learning codes. Keras makes our lives as deep learning engineers and researchers much easier.\n",

        "Deep learning is not a new subject in machine learning, in fact, early papers on the subject are as old as other machine learning papers and some of them go back to the 1970s. But, it was not the mainstream and there were not many resources for the subject. Consequently, there were not many software packages for deep learning (and in general neural networks). For that, according to one of Google engineers, \"Nobody actually knows what is the best way to create a deep learning framework\".\n",
        "\n",
        "Tensorflow and Pytorch (and some other libraries like JAX) are basically tensor operating libraries combined with a GPU acceleration library. Of course, there are other components in both of them, but, the essence of what they consist of is these two components. So, let's take a look at what each of them does.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Tensor Operating Library\n",
        "\n",
        "A tensor is a multi-dimensional array. Almost all layers in a deep model, operate with tensors (with a few exceptions like the dropout layer which operates with matrices).\n",
        "A tensor operating library is a library that has implemented useful features to manipulate tensors. These features vary from simple math operations like adding and substracting to some more advanced features like convolutions and some others like converting tensors to numpy arrays and so on.\n",
        "\n",
        "This part of the library also performs gradient calculations.\n",
        "\n",
        "## GPU acceleration library\n",
        "\n",
        "GPU acceleration library is a library that can run use code on GPUs. GPUs are super fast for tensor operations. They can run operations in parallel (not with multiple threads, but, with hardware-implemented parallelism) that speeds up computations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that, TensorFlow can also run code on TPU (Tensor Processing Unit), a unique hardware that is designed by Google. Among all deep learning libraries, only TensorFlow can use this hardware. It's worth mentioning that cloud TPUs are just used by Google and no one can buy them.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's good to have deep learning libraries implementing this feature, otherwise, we should write CUDA code by ourselves, which is an absolute nightmare."
